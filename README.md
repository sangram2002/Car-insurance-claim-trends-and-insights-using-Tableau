## ðŸš— Auto Insurance Claims Analysis

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing car insurance claims to uncover high-risk customer segments and inform pricing strategies. Using a real-world dataset, we explored key factors such as vehicle type, driver demographics, and income to generate actionable business insights and recommendations.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To explore auto insurance claims data, identify patterns contributing to high claim rates, and present findings through interactive dashboards to support strategic decision-making in risk modeling and pricing.

### ðŸ§  Key Insights
- **Vehicle Type**: Panel trucks and minivans have the highest claim values; sports cars trigger frequent low-value claims.
- **Demographics**: Blue-collar workers and students are emerging high-claim segments; individuals with lower education file more claims.
- **Location & Marital Status**: Urban and married individuals show higher claim amounts.
- **Income & Education**: Higher income and education levels correlate with fewer high-value claims.

### ðŸ’¼ Business Recommendations
- Reevaluate premiums for panel trucks and commercial vehicles.
- Implement tiered pricing based on education and income levels.
- Design specialized products for blue-collar and student segments.

### ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** â€“ Interactive visualizations and storytelling  
- **Excel** â€“ Data inspection and quick exploratory analysis  
- **Python** (optional, for data validation and EDA)  

### ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
Delivered a strategic storyboard and summary dashboard for senior management, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize premiums, reduce risk exposure, and enhance customer satisfaction.
